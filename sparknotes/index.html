<h1 id="chapter-7-using-ability-scores">Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores</h1>
<p>There are six attributes (important
	<em>general</em> usage in brackets per my opinion; each class has different requirements):</p>
<ul>
	<li>Strength (most melee weapons (including all 2-handed melee weapons), carry capacity, climbing/swimming/jumping/other Athletics -- the badass stat)</li>
	<li>Dexterity (some melee weapons, ranged weapons, initiative, spell dodge, armour, Stealth -- the OP stat)</li>
	<li>Constitution (health, poison/disease resist -- always important, governs max HP)</li>
	<li>Intelligence (n/a)</li>
	<li>Wisdom (Perception, social Insight -- important for spotting threats or points of interest)</li>
	<li>Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, Persuasion -- important for social interaction)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ability-scores-and-modifiers">Ability Scores and Modifiers</h2>
<p>A score of 10-11 is &quot;average human,&quot; 20 is the maximum for player characters. Modifier is used much more than score.</p>

<h2 id="advantage-and-disadvantage">Advantage and Disadvantage</h2>
<p>Only affects d20 rolls.
	Advantage is &quot;roll 2d20 use highest,&quot; disadvantage is &quot;roll 2d20 use lowest.&quot;
	Neither effect stacks. You are either &quot;at advantage/at disadvantage,&quot; or not.
	Advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out.</p>
<h2 id="proficiency-bonus">Proficiency Bonus</h2>
<p>Only affects d20 rolls.
	Does not stack. You are either &quot;proficient,&quot; or not.</p>
<h2 id="ability-checks">Ability Checks</h2>
<p>When attempting to do anything that has a chance to fail.
	Roll a d20 and add relevant bonuses.
	Players generally trigger these by saying things like &quot;I try to hide&quot; or &quot;Can I examine X for traces of magic?&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="contests">Contests</h3>
<p>Tug-of-war scenarios. Highest roll (with bonuses) wins. Ties generally result in neither side winning.</p>
<h3 id="skills">Skills</h3>
<p>See &quot;Using Each Ability&quot; in the PHB for a breakdown.</p>
<h3 id="passive-checks">Passive Checks</h3>
<p>How good your character is when you&#39;re AFK.
	Passive scores are 10 + all relevant modifiers.
	Mainly used for passive Perception, for spotting stealthy enemies or hidden traps.</p>
<h3 id="working-together">Working Together</h3>
<p>One character proficient in a check can help another, giving them Advantage on their check.</p>
<h4 id="group-checks">Group Checks</h4>
<p>Can be called for by the DM. If at least half the group succeeds, the group succeeds.</p>
<h2 id="saving-throws">Saving Throws</h2>
<p>Roll a d20 and add relevant bonuses. Used to avoid negative effects.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-8-adventuring">Chapter 8: Adventuring</h1>
<h2 id="resting">Resting</h2>
<h3 id="short-rest">Short Rest</h3>
<p>1 hour rest (DM dependent). On completion, spend Hit Dice to heal. Some things recharge on short rest.</p>
<h3 id="long-rest">Long Rest</h3>
<p>8 hour rest (DM dependent). 6 hours minimum sleeping, 2 hours maximum light activity. Can&#39;t benefit from more than one in a 24-hour period. If interrupted by more than an hour of strenuous activity, must be restarted.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-9-combat">Chapter 9: Combat</h1>
<p>Turn-based, cycles through combatants in initiative order -- a round is one turn from each participant. A turn is action + bonus action + movement (all optional).</p>
<p>See
	<a href="https://cirrahn.github.io/dnd5e-quickref/quickref.html">this quick reference</a> for the short and sweet version, or to refer to when playing.
	Alternatively, see PHB p189-198, this stuff is all pretty important.</p>
